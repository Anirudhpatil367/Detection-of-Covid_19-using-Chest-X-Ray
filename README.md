# 📊 COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Ray

## 📝 Description

The COVID-19 Detection System leverages deep learning techniques to identify COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. By utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), the system analyzes the X-ray images to classify them as either positive or negative for COVID-19, providing an efficient tool for early detection and diagnosis.

## 🔍 Demonstration

This image illustrates the interface of the COVID-19 detection system, showcasing how chest X-ray images are processed and classified by the model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for interactive health messages)

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained using two folders of chest X-ray images:
- **COVID Positive**: Contains X-ray images of patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
- **Non-COVID**: Contains X-ray images of healthy patients or those with other conditions.

## 🚀 Future Scope

The COVID-19 Detection System can be enhanced in several ways:
- **Integration with Real-Time Data**: Implementing a feature that allows real-time monitoring and analysis of X-ray images from hospitals.
w- **Expansion to Other Diseases**: Adapting the model to detect other respiratory diseases by training on diverse datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Improving the user interface for easier navigation and enhanced user experience.
- **Mobile Application**: Developing a mobile app to allow users to upload images directly from their smartphones for quick analysis.
